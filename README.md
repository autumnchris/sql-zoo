# SQL Zoo

My solutions to the SQL tutorial challenges on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net).

Inspired by the [SQL Zoo assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-databases-sql-zoo) as part of the curriculum for the [Databases Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/databases) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
